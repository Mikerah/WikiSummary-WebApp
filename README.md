# WikiSummary-WebApp

## Overview
The WikiSummary web app is the online version of the [commandline tool](https://github.com/Mikerah/WikiSummary) I created a while ago. This app was created using the Django Web Framework and uses the [Wikipedia](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/wikipedia/) API for Python. This project was for me to imprint the basic steps to creating a Django web app and slightly improve my front-end web developing skills (They still suck).

## What I've learned
For this project, I got more familiar with Django's template language and Twitter's Bootstrap3. I also revive some basic HTML/CSS/JQuery knowledge from high school. I've implemented a carousel feature using Bootstrap with animations. I was able to also modify the carousel to the way I wanted by overriding Bootstrap classes. I've also learned more about forms in Django and more specifically about the widgets paramater for form fields. I've also learned how Django handles static files during production and deployment, enabling me to modify features to my liking as specified about. 

## Improvements
Every projects has areas that need improvements. In this project, the front end needs a lot of work. All my websites so far look like they came out of the 90s. Thus, I need to improve my design skills. My code isn't clean and needs documentation and comments. The code also contains bugs that need to be taken care of somehow. Maybe I could add social media links for people to share their favorite summaries on Facebook or Twitter. The site could be a single page web application as opposed to the current design.
